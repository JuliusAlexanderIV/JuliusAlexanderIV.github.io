I'm a Junior Computer & Systems Engineering and Computer Science dual major and Physics minor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which is a long-winded way to say that I like solving problems and making cool things.

I originally hail from Bloomington, IL where I attended Bloomington High School. In my time there I was a trumpet section leader in the Marching Band, member of the Wind Symphony, Math Team, and Scholastic Bowl. Later in school I became heavily involved in the drama department and played on the tennis team.

At RPI, I stay busy between extracurriculars and classwork. I'm an active member of the Racquetball Team and was RPI's Google Student Ambassador for 2 semesters. Since sophomore year I've been a brother of Lambda Chi Alpha where I serve as the Standards Chair on the Executive Committee and the Webmaster. I am also a founding member of a successful student-run lecture series called [Rensselaer TALKS](http://rensselaertalks.com).

Technically, my goal is to create systems that benefit users and the world. I strive for simplicity and clarity so Python has been my go-to when I need to get things done. Functional languages pique my interest due to the change in mindset that they provoke; Haskell has been my door into that world but I've recently been interested in Scala and am always looking for projects to apply that interest towards.
