Avoclock'o was designed during an intensive 10-week design course based around a simple premise: think of a problem and solve it. Our team realized that waking up in the morning is a challenge that hits close to home. College students are familiar with late nights and gruelling academics. We cherish our sleep and fear our smartphone alarms.

Avoclock'o attempts to solve the problem of 'snoozing' the alarm and going back to sleep. It's a product designed to wake you up and keep you up. The system consists of several components, or subsystems: an Android app serving as the timekeeper and UI, a light and speaker configuration for stimulating awakeness, a pressure sensor to determine if someone is laying in the bed, an Arduino to communicate with the app and control the lights and speaker, a wall/battery power switching circuit, and a housing and support system.
