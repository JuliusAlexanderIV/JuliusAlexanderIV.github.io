      I've done other stuff too. At Google I wrote a MySQL fuzz tester. At State Farm I developed an internal website and did work in Visual Basic to aggregate Test ID's and their information. Registering for classes is time-sensitive and stressful so I made a Chrome extension to expedite the process.
