      I'm a Junior Computer & Systems Engineering and Computer Science dual major and Physics minor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which is a pretty long-winded way to say that I like solving problems and making cool things for the betterment of the world.

      I originally hail from Bloomington, IL where I attended Bloomington High School. In my time there I was a trumpet section leader in the Marching Band, member of the Wind Symphony, Math Team, and Scholastic Bowl. As a Junior I auditioned for the spring musical, Hairspray, and was cast in the lead as Link, kicking off my involvement in drama for the rest of my high school career. I took AP Computer Science and AP Physics C as a Senior at BHS, igniting my fascination with computer science and electronics.

      At RPI, I stay busy between extracurriculars and classwork. Freshman year I joined the Racquetball Team and have been an active member ever since. Sophomore year I was the Google Student Ambassador on campus and joined Lambda Chi Alpha where I currently serve on the Executive Committee and as Webmaster. I was previously involved in writing a system to render Visual Logic Circuits for a Psychology research project.

      Technically, my goal is to create systems that benefit users and the world. I strive for simplicity and clarity so Python has been my go-to when I need to get things done. Functional languages pique my interest due to the change in mindset that they provoke; Haskell has been my door into that world. I've recently been interested in Go and Rust and am always looking for projects to apply that interest towards.
